    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Dutch Baby pancake is an oven-baked pancake that resembles an oversized popover or Yorkshire pudding. Typically baked in a skillet, a Dutch Baby pancake is also called a puff pancake, pfannkuchen (German pancake) or n√∂ckerl (Austrian pancake). According to food lore, the name Dutch Baby was coined by the daughter of a Seattle restaurateur, whose now-shuttered Mancas Cafe served German (or deutsch) pancakes. Deutsch evolved into Dutch, and hey, we love a good origin story.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioner's sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place butter in an ovenproof pan or cast iron skillet and place in the oven.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine eggs and milk in a bowl. Add flour, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt and whisk for 1 minute to remove lumps.</li>
        <li>Remove hot pan from oven and swirl melted butter to coat. Pour batter into the hot pan and return it to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pancake is puffed in the center and golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
